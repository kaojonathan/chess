TO DOS:


- implement update pawn move counter into move so that we can't move pawn twice after first pawn move (use numMoves) (think this is fixed)




- implement new Piece::move w/ castle and special moves?? then modify the player's/computer's move functions, then fix the game's move condition to reflect that, then decide whether computer can special move or not!!!

- check forced piece condition

- constantly check for bugs and record them here:
 - checkmate implenmentation not implemented into the game field yet?
 - 

- fix whatever error/bug you can find (we are quite limited on time)

- setup issue: game::update updates the graphics given the history array, whereas setup just inserts and deletes...
